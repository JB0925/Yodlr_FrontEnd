This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Yodlr Take Home Challenge for Springboard

Yodlr was a take home project that I completed for the Springboard Software Engineering Program. The requirements were designed to mock a take home project from an employer for a frontend engineering position. In this take home project, I was asked to do two things:

1). Implement a page where a user could register to use the ficticious app.
2). Create a (non-protected) Admin page where an "Admin" could view all users and update information on them as needed.

This application can be viewed with either of the following:

## Docker

To view this project via docker, you will need to clone both this repo and the backend for it into a local directory, run:

`docker-compose up -d --build` , and then visit localhost:3050.

Then run `docker-compose down` to stop the running container when you are finished.

## Non-Docker

Clone both this repo and the [Yodlr-Take-Home](https://github.com/JB0925/yodlr-take-home) repo into a local directory.

Then, start both servers by running `npm start` in both.
